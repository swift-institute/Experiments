extension IO.Event.Wakeup {
    /// Thread-safe channel for waking the poll thread.
    ///
    /// The `Wakeup.Channel` provides a way for the selector actor to wake
    /// the poll thread without needing access to the driver handle. This
    /// is essential because:
    /// - The handle is owned by the poll thread
    /// - The selector needs to signal shutdown, new registrations, etc.
    /// - The wakeup mechanism must be thread-safe
    ///
    /// ## Platform Implementation
    /// - **kqueue**: Uses `EVFILT_USER` event
    /// - **epoll**: Uses `eventfd` write
    /// - **IOCP**: Uses `PostQueuedCompletionStatus` with sentinel
    ///
    /// ## Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// // Created during Selector.make()
    /// let wakeup = try driver.wakeup(handle)
    ///
    /// // Selector holds the channel
    /// // Can be called from any thread:
    /// wakeup.wake()
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Thread Safety
    /// The `wake()` method is thread-safe and can be called from any context.
    /// Multiple concurrent calls are coalesced (only one wakeup is delivered).
    public struct Channel: Sendable {
        /// The thread-safe wakeup closure.
        private let signal: @Sendable () -> Void

        /// Creates a wakeup channel with the given signal closure.
        ///
        /// - Parameter signal: A thread-safe closure that wakes the poll thread.
        public init(signal: @escaping @Sendable () -> Void) {
            self.signal = signal
        }
    }
}

extension IO.Event.Wakeup.Channel {
    /// Wake the poll thread.
    ///
    /// This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context,
    /// including from the selector actor, cancellation handlers, or
    /// other threads.
    ///
    /// If the poll thread is currently blocked in `poll()`, it will
    /// return with a wakeup event (or empty result, depending on
    /// implementation). If the poll thread is not blocked, the wakeup
    /// may be coalesced with the next poll.
    public func wake() {
        signal()
    }
}
